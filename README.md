# UnivaqThesisTemplate
This is a very simple LaTeX template to give you a baseline to start writing your thesis.<br />
This template is made for UnivAQ's students. Anyway, if you're from another university you can easily adapt it to your needs.

## Start using it

- Download the .zip file from this repository
- Rename the downloaded file according to your needs
- Import the .zip on https://it.overleaf.com
- Write your thesis :grin:

I've not much time to dedicate to this, feel free to contribute. :muscle:
